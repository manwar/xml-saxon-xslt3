NAME
    XML::Saxon::XSLT2 - process XSLT 2.0 using Saxon 9.x.

SYNOPSIS
     my $trans  = XML::Saxon::XSLT2->new( $xslt );
     my $output = $trans->transform($input);

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements XSLT 1.0 and 2.0 using Saxon 9.x via
    Inline::Java.

    It expects Saxon to be installed in either
    '/usr/share/java/saxon9he.jar' or '/usr/local/share/java/saxon9he.jar'.
    Future versions should be more flexible. The saxon9he.jar file can be
    found at <http://saxon.sourceforge.net/> - just dowload the latest Java
    release of Saxon-HE 9.x, open the Zip archive, extract saxon9he.jar and
    save it to one of the two directories above.

  Constructor
    "XML::Saxon::XSLT2->new($xslt)"
        Creates a new transformation. $xslt may be a string, a file handle
        or an XML::LibXML::Document.

  Methods
    "$trans->parameters($key=>$value, $key2=>$value2, ...)"
        Sets transformation parameters prior to running the transformation.

        Each key is a parameter name.

        Each value is the parameter value. This may be a scalar, in which
        case it's treated as an xs:string; a DateTime object, which is
        treated as an xs:dateTime; a URI object, xs:anyURI; a Math::BigInt,
        xs:long; or an arrayref where the first element is the type and the
        second the value. For example:

         $trans->parameters(
            now           => DateTime->now,
            madrid_is_capital_of_spain => [ boolean => 1 ],
            price_of_fish => [ decimal => '1.99' ],
            my_link       => URI->new('http://example.com/'),
            your_link     => [ uri => 'http://example.net/' ],
            );

        The following types are supported via the arrayref notation: float,
        double, long (alias int, integer), decimal, bool (alias boolean),
        string, qname, uri, date, datetime. These are case-insensitive.

    "$trans->transform($doc, $type)"
        Run a transformation, returning the output as a string.

        $doc may be a string, a file handle or an XML::LibXML::Document.

        $type may be 'xml', 'xhtml', 'html' or 'text' to set the output
        mode. 'xml' is the default.

    "$trans->transform_document($doc, $type)"
        Run a transformation, returning the output as an
        XML::LibXML::Document.

        $doc may be a string, a file handle or an XML::LibXML::Document.

        $type may be 'xml', 'xhtml', 'html' or 'text' to set the output
        mode. 'xml' is the default.

        This method is slower than "transform".

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to <http://rt.cpan.org/>.

    Known limitations:

    *   xsl:message

        Saxon outputs messages written via <xsl:message> to STDERR. There
        doesn't seem to be any way to capture and return these messages (not
        even using Capture::Tiny or its ilk).

SEE ALSO
    "XML::LibXSLT" is probably more reliable, and allows you to define your
    own XSLT extension functions. However, the libxslt library that it's
    based on only supports XSLT 1.0.
